# Running the Project
It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2017 or 2019. The project was never configured to build for x86, and therefore x64 is used.

# Disclaimer
Everything in the project was made by me, which includes the code, graphics and sound effects. The game used to have music but was removed since I do not own the soundtracks.
